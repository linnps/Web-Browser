The course CPSC2713 in Auburn University is intended to give us a hands-on experience with an object-oriented visual programming language. We started from a single buttom to the whole software. By the end of this course we successfully developed a three-tier, graphical, event-driven desktop application, a web browser, using an object-oriented language (C#) and SQL database while incorporating essential software construction methodologies.
